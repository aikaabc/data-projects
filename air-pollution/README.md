# AirQualityXplore: Identifying Pollution Patterns for Health & Policy

## Overview

Me and my teammates analyzed real-time global air quality data to identify pollution patterns and provide insights for public health and policy decisions. Using a dataset from AirNow (developed by US EPA, NOAA, National Park Service, and other agencies), this project explores 4,940 records and 40 attributes—covering pollutant measurements, location details, and Air Quality Index (AQI) indicators—collected from around the globe on August 18, 2023.
